    <h1 id="about">About Me</h1>

    <p class="more">My name is Vella. I am a 23 year old who is currently residing with my dad and granny in Arizona.</p>
      <br>

    <p class="more">I grew up in a small town in Virgina with my dad and my granny.
      <br> 
    Growing up in a small town made me realize how toxic it is when everybody knows everything about everybody.
      <br> 
    That is probably the thing I hated the most about my small town.
      <br> 
    <b style="color: #64B48B;">But I didn't fully hate the town I grew up in.</b>
      <br>
      <br> 
    Growing up in a small town made me realize how nice being away from everything was. You could see the stars at night, without worrying about
      <br> 
    all of the city lights being in the way. We didn't have many activites we could do during our free time,
      <br> 
    so most of the time, we went for a drive or even to the local Walmart.
      <br> 
    In fact, after my Junior Prom, my friends and I decided to go walk around Walmart in our Prom dresses.
      <br>
      <br>
    <em><b style="color: #64B48B;">I never thought I would move to the other side of the country.</b></em></p>

      <br> 
      <p class="more">When I found out we were moving in September of 2019, I was nervous, to say the least. I didn't want to leave my friends. I enjoyed my job I had. I didn't
        <br>
     think I would ever be happy in a different state away from the majority of people I knew. I never would've guessed where it led me.
      <br> 
    When we moved, I rode with my dad for a bit. He was an OTR truck driver, so we went all around the US. I ended up visiting 46 of the 50 US states. 
      <br> 
    In May of 2020, we decided to come back to our new home and stay there. 3 years later and now I am working at Amazon in Prep. I'm in the Associate Safety Committee, Glamazon,
    <br>
    Women @ Amazon, FUN Committee, and more. I've worked in almost every department at my facility and am becoming a Learning Ambassador.
    <br>
    <br>
    Now I am learning Software Development to possibly go a different direction in my career.
